 * The checkout tile's call-to-action text.
 *
 * PS_TWO_TITLE is stored per language, and a language with no row of its own
 * reads as `false` rather than an empty string, which core's emptiness test
 * does not count as empty — so the brand-name fallback has to be driven by a
 * string comparison rather than by Tools::isEmpty().
 *
 * The title is rendered verbatim and gains no term length. That matches the
 * Magento and Magento Hyva tiles, where the payment method title only picks up
 * a " - N days" suffix once the buyer's selected term is attached to the
 * payment, which never happens at tile render.
